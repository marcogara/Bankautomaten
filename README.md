**Play-around project for Databank Connection with Java Backend Application**

To connect with the databank, you need to run the databank in XAMPP.

I am sure you can use any other server to host your databank, but then you have to find out yourself how to modify the URL/path that allows the connection.

The .jar files(mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.zip) are inside the folder. To connect them to your project in IntelliJ, follow these steps:

1. Go to File -> Project Structure -> Libraries.
2. Click on the "+" button.
3. Select the local path where you have stored the .jar files mentioned above.
4. Click "Done".

For a little fun, please note that the source code is in German.

Good luck!
