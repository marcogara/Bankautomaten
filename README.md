play-around projket for Databank connection with java backend application

To connect with the databank, you need to run the databank in XAMPP.

I am sure you can use any other server to host your databank, but then you have to find out yourself how to modify the URL/path that allows the connection.

The .jar files are inside the folder, so if you open them with JDK 20, everything should be fine.

For a little fun, the source code is in German. Good luck.
